This month, I want to get to a decent place in terms of the\nEntitiy Component System, and a more robust colliison detection using that\ncan leverage the Entity Component System. I also, want to try my hand on a\nPhysics engine, that would give entities posiitons and velocities.</p>\n<p>Technical debt wise, I want to fix the few hiccups that occur on occasion while\nstarting up (which I think is due to previous memory not being freed). I also\nwant to be able to benchmark games, and at the very least, display a FPS number.\nI don't want to use ImGUI just for this, but will have to if I don't find\nanother place to display it while a game window is open.</p>","frontmatter":{"updatedOn":"July 01, 2020","slug":"/game-engine-dev-log","title":"Ambient Dev Log - A Dev Log about my experience developing the Ambient Game Engine"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/game-engine-dev-log"}}}
